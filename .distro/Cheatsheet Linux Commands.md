## File & Directory Operations

Create, copy, move, and delete:

bash

```
# Create
touch file.txt                                         # Create empty file
mkdir folder                                           # Create directory
mkdir -p a/b/c                                         # Create nested directories

# Copy
cp file.txt copy.txt                                   # Copy file
cp -r folder newfolder                                 # Copy directory recursively

# Move / Rename
mv file.txt newname.txt                                # Rename file
mv file.txt folder/                                    # Move file into folder

# Delete
rm file.txt                                            # Delete file
rm -r folder                                           # Delete directory recursively
rm -rf folder                                          # Force delete (no confirmation, careful!)
rmdir folder                                           # Delete empty directory

# Create symbolic link
ln -s /path/to/original /path/to/link
```

## Viewing File Contents

Read files without opening an editor:

bash

```
cat file.txt                                           # Print entire file
cat -n file.txt                                        # Print with line numbers
tac file.txt                                           # Print file in reverse (line order)

less file.txt                                          # View file page by page (q to quit)
more file.txt                                          # Similar to less, older tool

head file.txt                                          # First 10 lines
head -n 20 file.txt                                    # First 20 lines
tail file.txt                                          # Last 10 lines
tail -n 20 file.txt                                    # Last 20 lines
tail -f file.txt                                       # Follow file (live updates, e.g. logs)

wc file.txt                                            # Word/line/byte count
wc -l file.txt                                         # Line count only
```

## Searching

Find files and text:

bash

```
# Find files by name
find . -name "*.txt"                                   # Search current dir recursively
find / -name "file.txt"                                # Search entire filesystem
find . -type d -name "src"                             # Find directories only
find . -type f -mtime -7                               # Files modified in last 7 days
find . -size +100M                                     # Files larger than 100MB

# grep (search text inside files)
grep "search" file.txt                                 # Search for text in file
grep -i "search" file.txt                              # Case-insensitive
grep -r "search" .                                     # Recursive search in directory
grep -n "search" file.txt                              # Show line numbers
grep -v "search" file.txt                              # Invert match (lines NOT containing)
grep -c "search" file.txt                              # Count matching lines
grep -E "regex_pattern" file.txt                       # Extended regex

# Combine find and grep
find . -name "*.js" | xargs grep "TODO"

# locate (faster, uses prebuilt index)
locate file.txt
updatedb                                               # Update the locate database

# which / whereis (find command location)
which python
whereis python
```

## File Permissions

Manage access control:

bash

```
# View permissions
ls -l file.txt                                         # -rwxr-xr-- format

# Change permissions (chmod)
chmod 755 file.txt                                     # rwxr-xr-x (owner: all, group/others: read+execute)
chmod 644 file.txt                                     # rw-r--r-- (owner: read+write, others: read)
chmod +x script.sh                                     # Add execute permission
chmod -x script.sh                                     # Remove execute permission
chmod -R 755 folder                                    # Apply recursively

# Permission numbers: 4=read, 2=write, 1=execute (sum them: 7=rwx, 5=r-x, etc.)

# Change ownership (chown)
chown user file.txt
chown user:group file.txt
chown -R user:group folder                             # Recursive

# Change group
chgrp group file.txt
```

## Process Management

Monitor and control running programs:

bash

```
ps                                                     # Show your running processes
ps aux                                                 # Show all processes (detailed)
ps aux | grep node                                     # Find specific process

top                                                    # Live process monitor (q to quit)
htop                                                   # Better interactive process monitor

kill PID                                               # Terminate process by ID
kill -9 PID                                            # Force kill
killall firefox                                        # Kill by process name
pkill -f "pattern"                                     # Kill by matching command

jobs                                                   # List background jobs
bg                                                     # Resume job in background
fg                                                     # Bring job to foreground
command &                                              # Run command in background
nohup command &                                        # Run command, survive terminal close

disown                                                 # Detach job from shell
```

## Disk & System Info

Check system resources:

bash

```
df -h                                                  # Disk space usage (human-readable)
du -h file.txt                                         # Size of a file
du -sh folder                                          # Total size of folder
du -sh */                                              # Size of each folder in current dir

free -h                                                # Memory usage (human-readable)

uname -a                                               # System/kernel info
uptime                                                 # System uptime and load
whoami                                                 # Current user
hostname                                               # Machine name
lscpu                                                  # CPU info
lsblk                                                  # List block devices/disks
```

## Networking

Common network commands:

bash

```
ping google.com                                        # Test connectivity
ping -c 4 google.com                                   # Ping 4 times then stop

curl https://api.example.com                           # Make HTTP request
curl -X POST -d "data" https://api.example.com
curl -o file.zip https://example.com/file.zip          # Download file

wget https://example.com/file.zip                      # Download file

ifconfig                                               # Network interfaces (older)
ip addr                                                # Network interfaces (modern)
ip a                                                   # Shorthand

netstat -tulpn                                         # Show listening ports (older)
ss -tulpn                                              # Show listening ports (modern)

nslookup example.com                                   # DNS lookup
dig example.com                                        # Detailed DNS lookup

ssh user@hostname                                      # Connect via SSH
ssh -i key.pem user@hostname                           # SSH with key
scp file.txt user@host:/path/                          # Copy file over SSH
scp -r folder user@host:/path/                         # Copy folder over SSH

hostname -I                                            # Show local IP
```

## Archives & Compression

Compress and extract files:

bash

```
# tar (most common archive format)
tar -cvf archive.tar folder/                           # Create archive
tar -xvf archive.tar                                   # Extract archive
tar -czvf archive.tar.gz folder/                       # Create compressed (gzip) archive
tar -xzvf archive.tar.gz                               # Extract .tar.gz
tar -tzvf archive.tar.gz                               # List contents without extracting

# zip / unzip
zip archive.zip file1 file2                            # Create zip
zip -r archive.zip folder/                             # Zip a folder recursively
unzip archive.zip                                      # Extract zip
unzip -l archive.zip                                   # List contents

# gzip
gzip file.txt                                          # Compress (creates file.txt.gz, removes original)
gunzip file.txt.gz                                     # Decompress
```

## Package Management

Install software (varies by distro):

bash

```
# Debian/Ubuntu (apt)
sudo apt update                                        # Refresh package list
sudo apt upgrade                                       # Upgrade all packages
sudo apt install package_name                          # Install package
sudo apt remove package_name                           # Remove package
sudo apt search package_name                           # Search for package

# Red Hat/CentOS/Fedora (yum/dnf)
sudo yum install package_name
sudo dnf install package_name

# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install package_name
brew update
brew upgrade
brew uninstall package_name
brew list
```

## Environment Variables

Manage shell environment:

bash

```
echo $PATH                                             # Print a variable
export VAR_NAME=value                                  # Set variable for current session
env                                                    # List all environment variables
printenv                                               # Same as env

# Persist across sessions (add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc)
export PATH="$PATH:/new/path"
source ~/.bashrc                                       # Reload shell config
```

## Redirection & Pipes

Control input/output flow:

bash

```
command > file.txt                                     # Redirect output to file (overwrite)
command >> file.txt                                    # Redirect output to file (append)
command < file.txt                                     # Use file as input
command 2> error.txt                                   # Redirect errors only
command > out.txt 2>&1                                 # Redirect both output and errors
command &> all.txt                                     # Shorthand for above

command1 | command2                                    # Pipe output of command1 into command2
cat file.txt | grep "search" | wc -l                   # Chain multiple pipes

command > /dev/null                                    # Discard output
command > /dev/null 2>&1                               # Discard output and errors
```

## Text Processing

Manipulate text from the command line:

bash

```
# sed (stream editor, find/replace)
sed 's/old/new/' file.txt                              # Replace first occurrence per line
sed 's/old/new/g' file.txt                             # Replace all occurrences
sed -i 's/old/new/g' file.txt                          # Edit file in place
sed -n '2,4p' file.txt                                 # Print lines 2-4

# awk (pattern scanning and processing)
awk '{print $1}' file.txt                              # Print first column
awk -F',' '{print $2}' file.txt                        # Use comma as delimiter
awk '{print NR, $0}' file.txt                          # Print with line numbers
awk '$3 > 100' file.txt                                # Filter rows by condition

# sort
sort file.txt                                          # Sort lines alphabetically
sort -n file.txt                                       # Sort numerically
sort -r file.txt                                       # Reverse order
sort -u file.txt                                       # Sort and remove duplicates
sort -k 2 file.txt                                     # Sort by 2nd column

# uniq (remove duplicate adjacent lines, usually after sort)
uniq file.txt
sort file.txt | uniq
sort file.txt | uniq -c                                # Count occurrences

# cut (extract columns)
cut -d',' -f1 file.txt                                 # Extract 1st comma-separated field
cut -c1-5 file.txt                                     # Extract characters 1-5

# tr (translate/replace characters)
echo "hello" | tr 'a-z' 'A-Z'                          # Convert to uppercase
tr -d '\n' < file.txt                                  # Remove newlines

# diff (compare files)
diff file1.txt file2.txt
diff -u file1.txt file2.txt                            # Unified format (like git diff)
```

## File Editing (Nano & Vim Basics)

Edit files directly in the terminal:

bash

```
# Nano (simple, beginner-friendly)

## System Services (systemd)

Manage background services:

bash

```
sudo systemctl start service_name                      # Start service
sudo systemctl stop service_name                       # Stop service
sudo systemctl restart service_name                    # Restart service
sudo systemctl status service_name                     # Check status
sudo systemctl enable service_name                     # Enable on boot
sudo systemctl disable service_name                    # Disable on boot
systemctl list-units --type=service                    # List all services

journalctl -u service_name                             # View logs for a service
journalctl -f                                          # Follow logs live
journalctl --since "1 hour ago"                        # Logs from a time range
```

## User Management

Manage system users:

bash

```
sudo useradd username                                  # Create user
sudo passwd username                                   # Set/change password
sudo userdel username                                  # Delete user
sudo userdel -r username                               # Delete user and home directory

sudo usermod -aG groupname username                    # Add user to group
groups username                                        # Show user's groups
id username                                            # Show user/group IDs

su username                                            # Switch user
sudo command                                           # Run command as root
sudo -i                                                # Start root shell
```

## Aliases & Shell Customization

Speed up common commands:

bash

```
# Create an alias (add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc for persistence)
alias ll='ls -la'
alias gs='git status'
alias ..='cd ..'

# Remove alias
unalias ll

# History
history                                                # Show command history
!123                                                   # Run command number 123 from history
!!                                                     # Run last command
Ctrl+R                                                 # Search command history interactively
```

## Common Patterns

Frequently used command combinations:

bash

```
# Find and delete files matching pattern
find . -name "*.log" -delete

# Find large files
find / -type f -size +100M 2>/dev/null

# Count files in directory
ls -1 | wc -l

# Watch a command run repeatedly
watch -n 2 "ls -la"                                    # Runs every 2 seconds

# Check what's using a port
lsof -i :8080
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep 8080

# Background a long-running task and log output
nohup long_command > output.log 2>&1 &

# Chain commands: run second only if first succeeds
command1 && command2

# Chain commands: run second regardless
command1 ; command2

# Run second only if first fails
command1 || command2

# Repeat a command N times
for i in {1..5}; do echo "Run $i"; done

# Quickly create a backup
cp file.txt file.txt.bak

# Check exit status of last command
echo $?

# Combine multiple grep filters
cat log.txt | grep "ERROR" | grep -v "test"
```
